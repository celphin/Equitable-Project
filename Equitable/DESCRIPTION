Description: Elphinstone, C. and Henry, G. (submitted to Ecology, 2018) show the multipurpose uses for the equitable transform.Functions useful for analysing two dimensional data sets are included in this package. A two dimensional data set (d) is transformed via Td<-transformE(d) and a variety of matrices associated with the equitable transform is placed in Td. A signal data set can be made via d<-eg4(2,2) and noise can be added to make a noisy 2D data set (d_noise) in a variety of ways as seen in the R script Short Examples.R. If Td and Td_noise are the results from running transformE then plotsummary(Td_noise,Td), plotsummary(Td) and plotsummary(Td_noise) summarize and plot information about the two transformations.
